Directions

You will need sqlite and go. Sqlite comes with OSX and go can be installed from golang.org.

The server is run with a namespace for the database which will be stored in a local file:

go run server.go gg

The client is an interactive prompt run with:

go run client.go

Solution is in range 1, 100. Questions are as follows and must be exact otherwise it is a 400, they were simplified due to lack of time to handle spaces

* less7
* more10
* odd
* even

There is a test that can be run as follows

cd server/
go test

Further testing and handling of edge cases such as HTTP method checking were deffered given the 3 hour time constraint. Client code was designed to be testable by having a public Game() function with depedencies passed as parameters for easy mocking. There is basic logging for the server.
